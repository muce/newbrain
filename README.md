NewBrain is a system for getting you own back on annoying people that cold call you or attempt to hack you.
It provides an automated reverse DOS attack on them to stop them and let them know who's boss.

Currently it's WIP but once deployed it will help keep you safe.

Any contributions are more than welcome.

More to come soon.
